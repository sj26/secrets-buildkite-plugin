# Cluster Secrets Buildkite Plugin

A Buildkite plugin used to fetch secrets from [Buildkite Secrets](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/security/secrets/buildkite-secrets),

## Storing Secrets

There are two options for storing and fetching secrets.

You can create a secret in your Buildkite cluster(s) from the Buildkite UI following the instructions in the documentation [here](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/security/secrets/buildkite-secrets#create-a-secret-using-the-buildkite-interface).

### One at a time

Create a Buildkite secret for each variable that you need to store. Paste the value of the secret into buildkite.com directly.

A `pipeline.yml` like this will read each secret out into a ENV variable:

```yml
steps:
  - command: echo "The content of ANIMAL is \$ANIMAL"
    plugins:
      - cluster-secrets#v0.1.0:
          variables:
            ANIMAL: llamas
            FOO: bar
```

### Multiple

Create a single Buildkite secret with one variable per line, encoded as base64 for storage. 

For example, setting three variables looks like this in a file:

```shell
Foo=bar
SECRET_KEY=llamas
COFFEE=more
```

Then encode the file:

```shell
cat data.txt | base64
```

Next, upload the base64 encoded data to buildkite.com in your browser with a
key of your choosing - like `llamas`. The three secrets can be read into the
job environment using a pipeline.yml like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - command: build.sh
    plugins:
      - cluster-secrets#v0.1.0:
          key: "llamas"
```

## Options

### `key` (optional, string)
The key to fetch multiple from Buildkite secrets

### `variables` (optional, object)
Specify a dictionary of `key: value` pairs to inject as environment variables, where the key is the name of the
environment variable to be set, and the value is the Buildkite Secret key.

## Testing
You can run the tests using `docker-compose`:
```bash
docker compose run --rm tests
```
